# Coding Quiz

## Description

My motivation was to create a quiz for anyone to test their knowledge on JavaScript. They can then record their high scores. 

I build this project because I want to help others to learn more about JavaScript and to deepen their knowledge in it.

The problem that is solved is that it helped others to understand JavaScript.

I learned that Flexbox is useful in certain situations and using mulitple functions can make things easier.
